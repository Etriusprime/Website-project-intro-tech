with the armour of faith and a two-handed power sword known as the Black sword. Their sole purpose is to go out into the battlefield and challenge the enemey champions
into single combat. The Emperor's champion is blessed with strength and skill that allows to take down fromidable opponent
The champion symbolizes the Black Templars' zealous nature, serving as both a champion of battle and a beacon of the Chapter's righteous zeal.

of all space marines. Under his command, the Black Templars have participated in numerous Crusades such as the Third War for Armageddon and the Indomitus crusade , showcasing their commitment to the Imperium.
Helbrecht's strategic mind and inspirational presence have made him a respected leader among the Astartes and a feared opponent to those who stand against the Imperium.
