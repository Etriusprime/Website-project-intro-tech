        <h1 class="para_outline"> The VII Legion </h1>
<p class="para_outline">The Space Marines are the foremost defenders of mankind in the Warhammer 40K universe. They are genetically altered super soldiers who were designed by the Emperor of Mankind to battle against all who oppose the Imperium of man. 
Space marines are untouched by plague or any natural disease and can suffer wounds that would kill lesser beings and continue to fight. 
There are thousands of Chapters of Space Marines each having their own unique stories, characters, and style. Here I want to focus on the VII legion one of the first founding chapters  the Imperial Fists,
their Primarch and two sucessor chapters

            <p class="para_outline"> The Imperial fists the VII legion was among the original twenty space marine legions. They are known for their expertise in seige and 
defensive warfare, as they are capable of constructing and holding indomitable bastions while also analyzing and exploiting weak points in enemy defences. They are
a fleet based chapter as they have no homeworld but instead uses a massive starship known as the Phalanx to be used as their homebase. It is a mobile fortress so large
that it can be considered a moon and it is the Imperial Fists main source of recruitment of space marines. A major character in the VII legion history is Sigismund the first Emperor's Champion.
He was known as the greatest fighter, duelist, and swordsman of any astartes. He has bested a plethora of enemy champions and became the founder and leader of the sucessor chapter the Black Templars
The Imperial fists are resiliant warriors and unshakeable defenders, able to withstand any foe that threatens their imperium. Regardless of how numerous or powerful thier foe are they stand unmovable, resolute in defending their fortifications.
They have claimed many titles in thier times but one is well known to all, as they are the Defenders of Holy Terra
