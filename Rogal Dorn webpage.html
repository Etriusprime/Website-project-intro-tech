            <p class="para_outline"> After centuries of fighting, reclaiming and conquering new worlds for the Imperium in the great Crusade
he was called back by the Emperor himself to come to Terra and design defences for the Imperial Palace. These defences would prove their usefullness
in the coming years as the greatest and most devestaing civil war in history of mankind would commence. This civil war was known as the Horus Heresy,
this rebellion was lead by Horus Lupercal the Warmaster of the Imperium who the Emperor personally appointed too. Horus was corrupted by the ruinous 
powers of chaos and now they use him as a vessel to inact their will. For seven years in the 31st millennium Rogal Dorn and Seven of his brothers who 
remained alive and loyal would face off against Nine brothers that turned traitor. The Emperor appointed Dorn as the new warmaster and dubbed him Praetorian of Terra, entrusted to defend the Imperium while the emperor works on his secret project.
However Dorn for majority of the war fought and defended the imperium alone. His other brothers were scattered across the milky way fighting their battles that was laid out by the heretic warmaster, unable to come to his aid.
Others and their legions were decimated to degree that their fighting capabilites became of any significant of help. Alone Rogal and his legion was but they never wavered,
each battle they exacted a great toll from the enemy making each engagement hurt for their forces. When the war was over the destruction and death for both sides were great.
many of Rogals brothers and their legions have died and the Emperor was mortally wounded and had to be entombed on the golden throne to prevent his death. Rogal Lamented on
of the war beliving he failed his Father. He lead his legion on a crusade across the Imperium to hunt down and kill all traitors. During an attack of a chaos fleet he boarded
one of thier battleships he dissapered. After the battle was over his Legion searched fo him only finding his left hand. The Imperial Fists put the hand in stasis and it serves as an important
relic and inspiration to them. His current whereabout are unclear, but some say he will return once more when the Imperium needs a defender.
